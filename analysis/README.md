## Data Analysis

Behavioral data were analyzed using **JASP**.

Accuracy (percentage correct) was calculated for each participant and condition.

A repeated-measures ANOVA was conducted with the following factors:
- **Background harmony** (consonant vs. dissonant)
- **Figure presence** (present vs. absent)
- **Target category** (no-sharp vs. sharp)

Post-hoc comparisons were performed using pairwise tests
where appropriate.

This repository reports the analysis procedure.
Statistical results and figures are not included.
